# MERN/Next.js Learning and Error Resolution Platform

## Overview

The **MERN/Next.js Learning and Error Resolution Platform** is an innovative open-source tool I’m developing to assist developers by integrating educational resources with real-time troubleshooting into a single, powerful solution. Whether you’re just starting with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Next.js, or you’re an experienced developer, this platform is designed to enhance your learning and problem-solving experience.
